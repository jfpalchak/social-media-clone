## Description

Social Media Clone is a simple React application intended only for practice & learning purposes. The project is a solution to a prompt in which the application must clone a given social media site mock-up, and practice breaking each element of the site into their own components.

The final result of the Social Media Clone can be found below:

Some liberties were taken with particular elements of the design, such as profile pictures.

For the planning stages of building the clone, a diagram was drawn up into the following components:

The original mock-up that was to be copied is shown below:
